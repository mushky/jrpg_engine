# Map Defaults

# Maps are on a 16x16 Cartesian Grid

# Ability to move on the tiles is represented by a number system from 0-50.
# The higher the number, the more difficult it is to move on that particular terrain.

# For example: 
# If the player rolls an 8 on their movement roll they will be able to move across 8
# spaces on the map if the spaces are all '0.' However, if the player encounters a 1
# or higher number then that number is subtracted from the 8 roll that was just rolled.

# Thus more agile units will be able to move through more difficult terrain and slower
# units will either have to go around difficult terrain or tread slowly.
